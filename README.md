# Simple-Interactive-Drawing-Tool-using-Python-OpenCV
The Simple Interactive Drawing Tool is a Python script using the OpenCV library that provides a basic interactive drawing interface. It creates a blank canvas, and you can draw circles on it by double-clicking with the left, right, or both mouse buttons. The program runs until you press the 'q' key to exit.
